      Hiring Manager<br>
      TechNova Solutions<br>
      Tidel Park, Chennai - 600113
    </p>

    <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Application for Software Developer Intern Position</p>

    <p>
      I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Developer Intern position at TechNova Solutions. As a third-year B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Shiv Nadar University, Chennai, I am passionate about building intelligent systems and practical software solutions that solve real-world problems. My academic performance (CGPA 8.68/10) and hands-on experience position me well for this opportunity.
    </p>

    <p>
      I recently completed a Software Internship at <strong>Element5</strong>, where I developed an ARE chatbot using <strong>Rasa</strong> and Python, integrating use-case-specific dialogues and logic. My responsibilities included not only coding but also collaborating with team members, adapting to feedback, and meeting project deadlines.
    </p>

    <p>
      Prior to this, I worked remotely with <strong>Unified Mentor</strong> as a Data Analyst, where I analyzed employee attrition data, focusing on meaningful patterns and insights. These experiences have sharpened my technical foundation and introduced me to agile team dynamics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside internships, I enjoy working on creative tech projects. One of my favorites is the <strong>AI Resume Optimiser</strong>, built using Flask, FastAPI, and Llama LLM, which intelligently evaluates resumes and generates job-specific interview questions. I also developed a secure <strong>Blogging Platform</strong> with user authentication, admin control, and notification systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am comfortable with technologies like Python, Java, C, HTML, and MySQL, and I love combining backend logic with clean user-facing interfaces. I’m also a SNUC Hacks finalist and constantly explore ways to apply AI meaningfully.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m excited about the chance to bring my enthusiasm, skills, and ideas to your team. I’d be grateful for the opportunity to contribute to TechNova Solutions’ innovative projects and to learn from your talented professionals.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for considering my application.</p>
